## Long-term todo

## Short-term todo (優先度順)
* use explicit BC in forward model
  * 6/13: almost done
  * visualization
* write a test code
* use explicit BC in backward model
* check how random value is created
  * in 6eaebd5 (6/13), each ETKF experiments start with different random members, depending on the order of experiments

## memo
* [weakly coupled with persistent BC in the window] may be sufficiently good
